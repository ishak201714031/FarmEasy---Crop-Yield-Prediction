# FarmEasy---Crop-Yield-Prediction
This project aims to analyze the primitive approach of cultivation and develop a model for crop prediction using machine learning and provide a model for proper crops management after production. We propose an intelligent system that can predict the best possible crops only by providing the present location of a farmer.
